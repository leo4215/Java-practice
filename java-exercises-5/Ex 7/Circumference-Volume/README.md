# Automated-Plant-Watering-System---Arduino

Author: Leonardo

This Arduino code represents an Automated Plant Watering System by utilizing a soil moisture sensor to measure the moisture level in the soil. 

The LCD display provides real-time information about the soil's moisture percentage, and based on the readings, the system automatically controls a water pump, red and green LEDs, and a piezo buzzer. When the soil moisture falls below a set threshold (50%), the water pump is activated, the green LED turns on, and a buzzer sound is played. Conversely, when the moisture is sufficient, the water pump turns off, the red LED is illuminated, and the system indicates "OFF" on the display.

Components used:

• Arduino Uno R3
• LiquidCrystal Library (for LCD control)
• Soil Moisture Sensor
• Piezo Buzzer
• Red LED
• Green LED
• Water Pump Relay
• LCD Display (16x2)
• Connecting Wires
• Resistors
• Potentiometer

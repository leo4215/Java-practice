## Exercise description

On an online course platform, each user has a unique code represented by an integer. Each instructor on the platform can have multiple courses, and a student can enroll in as many courses as they like. Therefore, the total number of students an instructor has is not simply the sum of the students in all their courses, as there may be students enrolled in more than one course.

Instructor Alex has three courses, A, B, and C, and wants to know his total number of students. Your program should read the students from courses A, B, and C of instructor Alex, and then display his total number of students as shown in the example.

## Exercise description

A company wishes to automate the processing of its contracts. The processing of a contract involves generating the installments to be paid for that contract, based on the desired number of months.

The company uses an online payment service to process the payment of installments. Online payment services typically charge a monthly interest rate as well as a payment fee. Currently, the service contracted by the company is PayPal, which applies a simple interest rate of 1% on each installment, plus a payment fee of 2%.

Develop a program to read the contract data (contract number, contract date, and total contract value). Then, the program should read the number of months for the contract installments and generate the records for the installments to be paid (date and amount), with the first installment to be paid one month after the contract date, the second installment two months after the contract date, and so on. Display the installment data on the screen.

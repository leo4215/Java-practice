## Exercise description

A Brazilian car rental company charges an hourly rate for rentals of up to 12 hours. However, if the rental duration exceeds 12 hours, the rental will be charged based on a daily rate. In addition to the rental cost, a tax is added to the price according to the country's rules, which, in the case of Brazil, is 20% for amounts up to 100.00 or 15% for amounts above 100.00. 

Write a program that reads the rental data (car model, rental start and end times), as well as the hourly rate and daily rental rate. The program should then generate the payment receipt (containing the rental amount, tax amount, and total payment amount) and display the information on the screen. See the examples.

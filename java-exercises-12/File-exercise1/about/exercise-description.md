## Exercise description

Write a program to read the path of a .csv file containing data on sold items. Each item has a name, unit price, and quantity, separated by commas.

You should generate a new file called 'summary.csv', located in a subfolder named 'out' within the original folder of the source file, containing only the name and the total value for that item (unit price multiplied by the quantity), as shown in the example.

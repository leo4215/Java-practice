# Java practice

Within this repository, you will find a bunch of exercises and practices that I did during my Java studies. Every concept learned will be practiced and saved here for review later. This repository will be updated regularly according to my progression, including this README file.

Note that for each exercise you will find the code solution and its description, either as a comment or as a README file.

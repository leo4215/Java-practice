# Java practice

Within this repository, you will find a bunch of exercises that I did during my Java studies. Every concept learned will be practiced and saved here for review later. This repository will be updated regularly according to my progression, including this README file.

Please, note that from folder 1 to 4, the exercises will be found as single files. From folder 5 onward, they will be inside their own folder. For each exercise you will find the code solution and its description, either as a comment or as a README file.

Contents:

• Exercises 1: Sequential Structure (input, processing, output)
• Exercises 2: Conditional Structure (if-else)
• Exercises 3: Repetitive Structure (while, do-while)
• Exercises 4: Repetitive Structure (for)
• Exercises 5: Classes, attributes, methods, functions, static members, construtors, "this", overloading, encapsulation, and access modifiers
• Exercises 6: Arrays
• Exercises 7: Lists, and 2D arrays
